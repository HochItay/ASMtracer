<p style="font-size:18px">The Overflow Flag (OF) is set to 1 when the result of an operation is too large or to small for the destination operand. Otherwise, it is set to 0. <br>
The Overflow flag have meaning only when we work with signed integers.<br>
<br> for example:
<pre>
mov al, b11111111
mov bl, b10
add al, bl ;b11111111 + b10 = b1 in 8-bit operations,
            therefore, OF will be set to 1
</pre>
