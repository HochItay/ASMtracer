 rbp is a special purpose callee-saved register, that usually used as a frame pointer.<br>
 Most function prologs look like this:<br>
 <pre>
 push rbp      ; Preserve current frame pointer
 mov rbp, rsp  ; Create new frame pointer pointing to current stack top
 sub rsp, X    ; allocate X bytes worth of locals on stack
 </pre>
 In that way, rbp is always points to the start of the frame, and the program can refer to local variables using it, for example:<br>
 <pre>mov rax, [rbp - 8]</pre>
<br>

 rbp lower bytes can be accessed by the following names:
