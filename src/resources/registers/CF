<p style="font-size:18px">The Carry Flag (CF) is set to 1 when the result of an operation is too large or to small for the destination operand. Otherwise, it is set to 0.<br>
The carry flag have meaning only when we work with unsigned integers.<br>
<br> for example:
<pre>
mov rax, 3
mov rbx, 4
sub rax, rbx ;3 - 4 = -1, therefore, CF will be set to 1
</pre>
